*       @brief      This file contains data types which, when used by all
*                   systems, will eliminate all confusion that C introduces with
*                   respect to data size.  Thrown in for good measure are some
*                   macros which perform the same function but are implemented
*                   differently for specific processor types.  Finally, there
*                   are some common constants (YES, NO, TRUE, FALSE, etc.)
